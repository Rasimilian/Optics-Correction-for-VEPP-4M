# Optics-Correction-for-VEPP-4M
A program for the magnetic structure correction (linear optics) of the VEPP-4M collider.

The program is intended for beam-based correction (errors finding) and optimization (fitting to a design model). Actually, orbit correction is possible as well.

It uses a response matrix approach with optimization algorithms: Gauss-Newton, Marquardt-Levenberg and supplemented with regularization (constains).

Possible parameters to be varied are quadrupoles gradients/shifts/rolls, dipoles gradients, BPMs shifts/rolls.
